# SpottyApp (SpotlightProgramGUI)
 Completely rewrote [Spotlight Program](https://github.com/CHR-onicles/SpotlightProgram) with GUI using PyQt5.
It retrieves the windows spotlight photos (which are raw files deep in root directory)
and allows the user to preview, favorite, delete or export on-the-go.
