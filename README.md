# SpottyApp (SpotlightProgramGUI)
 Completely rewrote [Spotlight Program](https://github.com/CHR-onicles/SpotlightProgram) with GUI using PyQt5.

## Description
This an app similar to a photo viewer but tailored specifically for Windows Spotlight Photos.
It retrieves the windows spotlight photos (These are the nature-filled wallpapers on your lockscreen on Win 10)
and allows the user to preview, favorite, delete or export on-the-go.
These photos are usually set by default as your lockscreen, but it is worth mentioning that you should at least check to be sure. App has simple
features and has good amount of tooltips to describe the functions of wdigets when you hover over them.
