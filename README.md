# SpottyApp v0.1
> Completely rewrote [Spotlight Program][old spotty link] with GUI using PyQt5.

## Description
> This is an app similar to a photo viewer, but tailored specifically for **Windows Spotlight Photos**.
It retrieves the Windows Spotlight Photos (These are the nature-filled wallpapers on your lockscreen on Win 10)
and allows the user to **preview**, **favorite**, **delete** or **export** on-the-go.
These photos are usually set by default as your lockscreen, but it is worth mentioning that you should at least check to be sure.

> * [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
