# SpottyApp (SpotlightProgramGUI) v0.1.0
> Completely rewrote [Spotlight Program](https://github.com/CHR-onicles/SpotlightProgram) with GUI using PyQt5.

## Description
> This an app similar to a photo viewer but tailored specifically for Windows Spotlight Photos.
It retrieves the windows spotlight photos (These are the nature-filled wallpapers on your lockscreen on Win 10)
and allows the user to preview, favorite, delete or export on-the-go.
These photos are usually set by default as your lockscreen, but it is worth mentioning that you should at least check to be sure. App has simple
features and has a good amount of tooltips to describe the functions of widgets when you hover over them.
